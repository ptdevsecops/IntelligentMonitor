# IntelligentMonitor

**Overview**
This repository contains a sample implementation of the IntelligentMonitor system proposed in the research paper "IntelligentMonitor: Empowering DevOps Environments With Advanced Monitoring and Observability", presented and published as part of the 11th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT 2023).

**IntelligentMonitor** aims to improve monitoring and observability in complex, distributed DevOps environments by leveraging machine learning and data analytics.

**Components**
The key components that would need to be implemented are:

* Data Collection - Collect performance metrics and log data from the distributed system components. Could use technology like Kafka or telemetry libraries.
* Data Processing - Preprocess and aggregate the collected data into an analyzable format. Could use Spark for distributed data processing.
* Anomaly Detection - Apply machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in the performance metrics. Could use isolation forest or LSTM models.
* Alerting - Generate alerts when anomalies are detected. It could integrate with tools like PagerDuty.
* Visualization - Create dashboards to visualize system health and key metrics. Could use Grafana or Kibana.
* Data Storage - Store the collected metrics and log data. Could use Elasticsearch or InfluxDB.


**Implementation Details**
The core of the implementation would involve the following:

* Setting up the data collection pipelines.
* Building and training anomaly detection ML models on historical data.
* Developing a real-time data processing pipeline.
* Creating an alerting framework that ties into the ML models.
* Building visualizations and dashboards.

The code would need to handle scaled-out, distributed execution for production environments.

Proper code documentation, logging, and testing would be added throughout the implementation.

**Usage Examples**
Usage examples could include:

* Running the data collection agents on each system component.
* Visualizing system metrics through Grafana dashboards.
* Investigating anomalies detected by the ML models.
* Tuning the alerting rules to minimize false positives.
* Correlating metrics with log data to troubleshoot issues.
